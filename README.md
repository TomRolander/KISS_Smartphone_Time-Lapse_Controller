# KISS_Smartphone_Time-Lapse_Controller
 
## Overview
The KISS Controller is used to create time-lapse videos or to take scheduled video recordings from a single position using a Smartphone Camera.  The KISS Controller is operated by a web based user interface running on a Smartphone or Laptop to direct the sequence of the video recording or photographs to create a time lapse video.

The components of the KISS system include an adjustable height camera holder, an ESP32 WROOM microcontroller which provides a bluetooth keyboard for the camera shutter to take photos and a WiFi access point for the User Interface, and a controllable four outlet power relay module that the microcontroller uses to turn on a light during the video recording or photography. In addition, the system includes a Python program to watermark the photos and create the time-lapse video.

The purpose of this document is to describe the setup, operation, DIY construction, hardware, and software of the KISS Smartphone Time-Lapse Controller.
